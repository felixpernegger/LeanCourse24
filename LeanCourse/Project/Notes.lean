/- This serves as a note to the project.

Goals for tuesday:

-Remake most theorem so they fit the new line definition. This is unfortunate, but unavoidable.

-Try to prove the axioms given in euclid (if they are provable / make sense). This is very much advicable as any geometry theorem should be able to derived purely from that standpoint further on and not rely on complex numbers.

Stretch:

-Correct the definition of similar triangles and in the theorems

-For theorems proves with compelx number it might be best to first prove it for the special case of the unit circle
  and then prove it for general traingles / circles -/


--Beofre doing ANYTHING FURTHER with Triangles etc, I have to finish lines first.
--Namely:


--new main goal is to prove parallel_trans and the stuff missing for parallel_postulate
--Laying a parallel through a point, fix the order etc.
--Introduce scaling. Redo oldSimilar with scaling (not much should change). And rename oldSimilar to verysimilar or something


--NOT EVEN COPUNCTAL YET!
