/- This serves as a note to the project.






MAJOR REDO NEEDED (TOP PRIORITY):

Give an alternative definition for colinear, namely a b c are colinear, iff (a-b)/(a-c) is real (hard, but maybe lean does most of it). We dont even have to care about b c or so being the same
Using this do:
-First show that if two complex numbers are real, so is their product (very easy)
-Reprove colinear trans (very easy)
-Give "usual" definition of colinear (easy)
-A line can be interpreted as a point and a nonzero vector (realtively easy)

Then do following:
-A line can always be represented a line through two points (being on it) (easy, maybe ive done this already) (DONE BUT NOT NICELY)
-A line shifted by a point is a line
-Two (point, vector) lines are parallel iff the quotient of their vector is real (relatively easy I think)
-Two (point, point) lines, (a,b) and (x,y) are parallel is (a-b)/(x-y) is real.
-With this (maybe (point, vector) is better), define line_thorugh properly and prove parallel_trans (easy)





-Try to prove the axioms given in euclid (if they are provable / make sense). This is very much advicable as any geometry theorem should be able to derived purely from that standpoint further on and not rely on complex numbers.

Stretch:

-Correct the definition of similar triangles and in the theorems

-For theorems proves with compelx number it might be best to first prove it for the special case of the unit circle
  and then prove it for general traingles / circles -/


--Beofre doing ANYTHING FURTHER with Triangles etc, I have to finish lines first.
--Namely:


--new main goal is to prove parallel_trans and the stuff missing for parallel_postulate
--Laying a parallel through a point, fix the order etc.
--Introduce scaling. Redo oldSimilar with scaling (not much should change). And rename oldSimilar to verysimilar or something


--NOT EVEN COPUNCTAL YET!
