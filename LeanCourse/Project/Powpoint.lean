noncomputable section

/-In this section we introduce the power of a point respective a circle.
We will *not* prove the pretty central result that not matter how you intersect
the circle, the product/power of distances stays the same.

We instead focus on the formal definitions and the power line and and some results.
This will later be used for proving the existance of the orthocenter.-/
