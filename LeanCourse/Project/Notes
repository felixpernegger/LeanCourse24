This serves as a note to the project.

Goals for tuesday:

- Make a Line structure. The way the 'Line Function' is defined does work, but it is increasingly clear it is not the right way to define geometry.
For example, the parallel postulate looks gruesome if you define it via points. Therefore the only sensible way for Lines is to actually introduce a Line structre for what it is worth. This has to be done eventually and it is probably better to do it sooner than later.
Furthermore, it is probably advisable to define a line not via linear but via the definition in linear_def, theorefore proving linear_def is a priority.

-Remake most theorem so they fit the new line definition. This is unfortunate, but unavoidable.

-Try to prove the axioms given in euclid (if they are provable / make sense). This is very much advicable as any geometry theorem should be able to derived purely from that standpoint further on and not rely on complex numbers.

Stretch:

-Correct the definition of similar triangles and in the theorems
