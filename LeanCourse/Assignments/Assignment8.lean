/- You can use `filter_upwards` to conveniently conclude `Eventually` statements from `Eventually`
in one or more hypotheses using the same filter. -/

/- The goal of the following exercise is to prove that
the regular open sets in a topological space form a complete boolean algebra.
`U ⊔ V` is given by `interior (closure (U ∪ V))`.
`U ⊓ V` is given by `U ∩ V`. -/

  carrier : Set X
  isOpen : IsOpen carrier
  regular' : interior (closure carrier) = carrier

namespace RegularOpens

  coe := RegularOpens.carrier

@[ext] theorem ext (h : (U : Set X) = V) : U = V :=

/- First we want a complete lattice structure on the regular open sets.
We can obtain this from a so-called `GaloisCoinsertion` with the closed sets.
This is a pair of maps
* `l : RegularOpens X → Closeds X`
* `r : Closeds X → RegularOpens X`
with the properties that
* for any `U : RegularOpens X` and `C : Closeds X` we have `l U ≤ C ↔ U ≤ r U`
* `r ∘ l = id`
If you know category theory, this is an *adjunction* between orders
(or more precisely, a coreflection).

a filter of the form `if q then F else G`. The next exercise is a more concrete application.

/- To be more concrete, we can use the previous lemma to prove the following.
if we denote the characteristic function of `A` by `1_A`, and `f : ℝ → ℝ` is a function,
then  `f * 1_{s i}` tends to `f * 1_t` iff `x ∈ s i` is eventually equivalent to
`x ∈ t` for all `x`. (note that this does *not* necessarily mean that `s i = t` eventually).
`f * 1_t` is written `indicator t f` in Lean.
Useful lemmas for this exercise are `indicator_apply`, `apply_ite` and `tendsto_pi_nhds`. -/
